# JavaScript and Classes
JavaScript has a concept called "classes," but it's important to note that JavaScript's class system is often referred to as "syntactical sugar" over its prototype-based inheritance system. In JavaScript, classes are a more structured way to work with objects and constructors, but they are ultimately based on prototypes.

When you use the class keyword to define a class in JavaScript, you are essentially creating constructor functions and prototype methods behind the scenes. This provides a more familiar and organized syntax for working with objects and object-oriented programming.

So, while JavaScript has classes, it's important to understand that they are a higher-level abstraction over the underlying prototype system, which is unique to JavaScript. This class system was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to make object-oriented programming in JavaScript more approachable and familiar to developers who are used to class-based languages.

In summary, JavaScript does have classes, but they are implemented in a way that is rooted in JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance system.
